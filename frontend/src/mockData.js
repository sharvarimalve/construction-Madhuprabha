  title: "About Madhu Prabha Construction",
  shortDescription: "Leading residential construction company with 20 Glorious Years of experience in creating quality homes.",
  fullDescription: ` Madhu Prabha Constructions began its journey in 2005 as Ashish Construction,
                 founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to build structures that not only
                  meet but exceed expectations. Over the years, we have evolved from a small 
                  construction company to one of Maharashtra's most trusted construction partners.
                  Our transformation to Madhu Prabha Constructions reflects our growth while maintaining 
               the core values that have guided us from the beginning. We believe that construction is
                not just about building structures; it's about creating spaces where lives unfold, businesses 
                thrive, and communities flourish.
                  Today, with over 500 completed projects and more than 1000 satisfied clients, we continue 
               to set new standards in construction excellence, always staying true to our founding principles 
               of quality, integrity, and customer satisfaction.
